Description: Userspace implementation of IPv6 default gateway autoconfiguration
 This daemon listens for IPv6 router advertisments and dymanicly configures
 the default IPv6 route. This behaviour is implemented in the kernel, but
 disabled when IPv6 forwarding is enabled. This daemon allow a host which
 forwarding enabled to use multiple default gateways to protect against
 the case of a gateway failure like autoconfigured IPv6 hosts without
 participating in an additional dynamic routing protocol. Applications
 include NAT and VPN gateways and virtualization hosts.
